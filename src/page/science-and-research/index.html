          <p>
            Vilo takes medical seriousness to heart—but we don’t use science to alarm you. Our standard is clinical discipline in how we build and validate, and a gentle tone in how we communicate.

        <h2>Clinical rigor, with humility</h2>
        <p>
          To us, “backed by science” isn’t a vibe—it’s a method. We start with established approaches, validate carefully, and improve with feedback and expert review.. We prefer <strong>patterns over one-off readings</strong>, and we’re careful with language—clear, human, and non-diagnostic.

        <h2>Science that gets “seen”</h2>
        <p>
          We believe algorithms shouldn’t live inside a lab notebook or a codebase alone. Our work is shaped by cross-disciplinary review—sensor engineering, signal processing, physiology, and evidence-based wellness practice—so the standard stays serious, even when the product feels effortless.

          When Vilo suggests a micro-intervention, it’s optional—light enough to do in a minute, and easy to skip with zero guilt. These tools are drawn from approaches studied in clinical trials and systematic reviews for stress/anxiety support.

        <h2>Mindfulness and body-based resets</h2>
        <p>
          Mindfulness-based interventions have a substantial research base for anxiety and stress reactivity. We keep the delivery micro: body-first, quick practices like a brief body scan—studied even in short-session formats in some contexts.

        <h2>Grounding that brings you back to the present</h2>
        <p>
          Sensory grounding is widely used to interrupt spirals by anchoring attention in the “here and now.” Vilo includes a short five-senses grounding (your 3-2-1 variant), kept deliberately simple and non-performative.

        <h2>Somatic ease, not “optimization”</h2>
        <p>
          Some tools are less about performance and more about sending safety signals—softening the shoulders, releasing the jaw, warming the hands, scanning the body briefly. Where formal trials and systematic reviews exist (for example, progressive muscle relaxation), we lean on them; where evidence is more practice-based, we present it as optional comfort—not a cure.
